Uses of Javascript and JQuery:
  For this assignment, I've implemented a number of functions and made much use
  of the "ui-draggable" feature that jquery provides. However, despite this, I
  still had much difficulty trying to add images to the draggable tiles.

  To start, I made use of the provided JSON file from the "graphics_data" folder
  by Jesse, however couldn't parse the contents onto the ScrabbleTiles array.
  Instead, I settled for copy pasting the contents of the json directly onto the
  javascript file. From there, I made use of its properties and began implementing
  functions all unrelated to dragging and dropping the tiles. This included
  functions such as all the generates, score updates, and buttons. There was
  trouble with checking whether or not words counted as words in the dictionary.

  The drag and drop features from jquery required some keywords I never thought
  were even possible. Despite this, I still had trouble with dragging tiles
  after they've been moved in any way.
